# Database Router Implementation Requirements

This document outlines the implementation plan for the database backup and restore endpoints.

## Overview

Create a new router at `src/routes/database.ts` with 5 endpoints for managing database backups and restoration. All endpoints require authentication and admin-only access.

## Environment Variables

Required:
- `PATH_PROJECT_RESOURCES`: Base path where database_backups/ directory will be created

## Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| /database/create-backup | POST | Admin | Export all tables to CSV, zip folder, cleanup |
| /database/backups-list | GET | Admin | List all backup .zip files |
| /database/download-backup/:filename | GET | Admin | Download backup as attachment |
| /database/delete-backup/:filename | DELETE | Admin | Delete backup file |
| /database/replenish-database | POST | Admin | Restore database from uploaded .zip backup |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Middleware

Tasks:
- [ ] Create `src/modules/database/` directory
- [ ] Create `src/modules/database/export.ts` file (table export and CSV creation)
- [ ] Create `src/modules/database/compression.ts` file (zip/unzip operations)
- [ ] Create `src/modules/database/import.ts` file (CSV import and table restoration)
- [ ] Create `src/modules/database/validation.ts` file (filename validation, path security)
- [ ] Create `src/modules/database/filesystem.ts` file (directory creation, path management)
- [ ] Create `src/routes/database.ts` file
- [ ] Import required dependencies (express, fs, path, archiver, csv-writer, csv-parser, multer)
- [ ] Import database models from mantrify01db
- [ ] Import authMiddleware and create adminMiddleware (or verify admin in routes)
- [ ] Create router and apply authMiddleware to all routes
- [ ] Add admin check middleware/logic
- [ ] Register router in `src/index.ts` with `/database` path
- [ ] Add `PATH_PROJECT_RESOURCES` to required env vars validation in `src/index.ts`

### Phase 2: Helper Functions

All helper functions are organized in `src/modules/database/` following the modular pattern of the codebase.

#### src/modules/database/filesystem.ts
- [ ] `ensureBackupDirectory()` - Create `database_backups/` if missing
- [ ] `getBackupPath()` - Return full path to database_backups/
- [ ] `generateTimestamp()` - Create YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format timestamp
- [ ] `cleanupDirectory(dirPath)` - Delete folder and contents

#### src/modules/database/validation.ts
- [ ] `validateFilename(filename)` - Check for path traversal attacks (../, absolute paths)
- [ ] `validateZipExtension(filename)` - Ensure filename ends with .zip
- [ ] `sanitizeFilename(filename)` - Remove dangerous characters

#### src/modules/database/export.ts
- [ ] `getAllTables()` - Return list of all Sequelize models/tables
- [ ] `exportTableToCSV(tableName, outputPath)` - Export single table to CSV with headers
- [ ] `createBackup()` - Orchestrate full backup process (export all tables)

#### src/modules/database/compression.ts
- [ ] `zipDirectory(sourceDir, outPath)` - Zip directory using archiver
- [ ] `extractZip(zipPath, extractPath)` - Extract zip file for restore

#### src/modules/database/import.ts
- [ ] `importCSVToTable(csvPath, tableName)` - Import single CSV to table
- [ ] `restoreFromBackup(extractedPath)` - Orchestrate full restore process (import all CSVs)
- [ ] `parseCSVRow(row, tableName)` - Parse CSV row with NULL handling

### Phase 3: POST /database/create-backup

Tasks:
- [ ] Validate user is authenticated and admin
- [ ] Check PATH_PROJECT_RESOURCES env var exists
- [ ] Call `ensureBackupDirectory()` to create database_backups/ if needed
- [ ] Generate timestamp using `generateTimestamp()`
- [ ] Create backup folder name: `database_backup_${timestamp}`
- [ ] Create full backup folder path inside database_backups/
- [ ] Get list of all tables from database
- [ ] If no tables exist, throw error with AppError
- [ ] Loop through each table and export to CSV:
  - Name CSV file as `${tableName}.csv`
  - Include column headers in CSV
  - Represent NULL values as empty strings (standard CSV convention)
  - Log which table is being exported
  - If export fails, log error with table name and throw
- [ ] After all CSVs created, zip the backup folder
- [ ] Name zip file: `database_backup_${timestamp}.zip`
- [ ] If zipping fails, delete any partial files and throw error
- [ ] If zipping succeeds, delete original backup folder
- [ ] Delete any non-.zip files in case of partial failure
- [ ] Return success response with backup filename and path
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with proper logging

### Phase 4: GET /database/backups-list

Tasks:
- [ ] Validate user is authenticated and admin
- [ ] Check PATH_PROJECT_RESOURCES env var exists
- [ ] Get path to database_backups/ directory
- [ ] Check if directory exists; if not, return empty array
- [ ] Read all files in database_backups/ directory
- [ ] Filter to only .zip files
- [ ] Get file stats (size, creation date) for each backup
- [ ] Sort by creation date (newest first)
- [ ] Return array of backup files with metadata:
  - filename
  - size (in bytes or MB)
  - createdAt (timestamp)
- [ ] Add error handling and logging

### Phase 5: GET /database/download-backup/:filename

Tasks:
- [ ] Validate user is authenticated and admin
- [ ] Extract :filename param from request
- [ ] Validate filename includes .zip extension
- [ ] Validate filename against path traversal attacks (no ../, absolute paths, etc.)
- [ ] Check PATH_PROJECT_RESOURCES env var exists
- [ ] Construct full path to backup file
- [ ] Check if file exists; if not, return 404
- [ ] Verify file is actually a file (not directory)
- [ ] Set response headers:
  - Content-Type: application/zip
  - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="${filename}"
  - Content-Length: file size
- [ ] Stream file to response using fs.createReadStream
- [ ] Add error handling for file read errors
- [ ] Log download event with admin user ID and filename

### Phase 6: DELETE /database/delete-backup/:filename

Tasks:
- [ ] Validate user is authenticated and admin
- [ ] Extract :filename param from request
- [ ] Validate filename includes .zip extension
- [ ] Validate filename against path traversal attacks
- [ ] Check PATH_PROJECT_RESOURCES env var exists
- [ ] Construct full path to backup file
- [ ] Check if file exists; if not, return 404
- [ ] Verify file is actually a file (not directory)
- [ ] Delete the file using fs.unlinkSync or fs.promises.unlink
- [ ] If deletion fails, log error and throw AppError
- [ ] Return success response with deleted filename
- [ ] Log deletion event with admin user ID and filename

### Phase 7: POST /database/replenish-database

Tasks:
- [ ] Validate user is authenticated and admin
- [ ] Set up multer middleware for file upload (accept .zip only)
- [ ] Validate uploaded file exists
- [ ] Validate uploaded file is a .zip file
- [ ] Create temporary extraction directory with unique name
- [ ] Extract .zip file to temporary directory
- [ ] Read all .csv files from extracted directory
- [ ] For each CSV file:
  - Parse filename to determine table name (remove .csv extension)
  - Validate table exists in database
  - Read CSV with headers
  - Parse each row and insert into database
  - Handle NULL values (empty strings -> null)
  - Log progress (e.g., "Importing X rows into TableName")
  - If import fails, log which table/row failed
- [ ] Use transaction for all imports (rollback on failure)
- [ ] After successful import, cleanup temporary directory
- [ ] Delete uploaded .zip file
- [ ] Return success response with:
  - Number of tables imported
  - Number of rows imported per table
  - Total rows imported
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - Invalid zip file
  - Missing CSV files
  - Table doesn't exist
  - CSV format errors

- [ ] Test replenish-database with invalid table names
- [ ] Test replenish-database transaction rollback on failure
- [ ] Test all endpoints without authentication (401)
- [ ] Test all endpoints with non-admin user (403)
- [ ] Run build and verify no TypeScript errors

## Technical Details

### CSV Format
- First row contains column headers (exact column names from database)
- NULL values represented as empty strings
- Standard CSV escaping for special characters (quotes, commas, newlines)
- UTF-8 encoding

### Backup File Structure
```
database_backup_20260206_143022/
├── Users.csv
├── Mantras.csv
├── ContractUsersMantras.csv
├── ContractUserMantraListen.csv
├── ElevenLabsFiles.csv
├── Queue.csv
├── SoundFiles.csv
├── ContractMantrasElevenLabsFiles.csv
└── ContractMantrasSoundFiles.csv
```

After zipping: `database_backup_20260206_143022.zip`

### Tables to Export/Import
1. Users
2. Mantras
3. ContractUsersMantras
4. ContractUserMantraListen
5. ElevenLabsFiles
6. Queue
7. SoundFiles
8. ContractMantrasElevenLabsFiles
9. ContractMantrasSoundFiles

### Security Considerations
- All endpoints require admin authentication
- Path traversal validation on filename params
- File type validation on uploads
- Sanitize filenames to prevent command injection
- Use transactions for database restoration
- Log all database operations with admin user ID

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
npm install archiver csv-writer csv-parser multer
npm install --save-dev @types/archiver @types/multer
```
